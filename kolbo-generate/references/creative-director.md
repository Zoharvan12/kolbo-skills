# Creative Director — Multi-Scene Prompt Rules

Load this file when the user wants **2–8 related outputs from one brief** — storyboards, ad campaigns, character lookbooks, multi-angle/multi-pose sets, scene variations. For single-image work see `models/gpt-image.md` / `models/nano-banana.md`. For single-clip video see `models/seedance.md` / `models/veo.md`.

**Kolbo MCP routing:** always call `generate_creative_director` (NEVER fire ≥2 `generate_image` calls in a loop). Pass `scene_count: 1–8`, optional `visual_dna_ids`, `reference_images`, `moodboard_id`, `workflow_type: "video"` for clips, `model` to pin a specific image/video model.

## What the Creative Director Tool Is

A multi-scene batch generator. Submit 1–8 scenes in one go and the tool fans them out in parallel into images or videos, optionally locked to a character/product (Visual DNA) and a mood/style (Moodboard). Total wall time = slowest scene, not the sum.

### The Three Modes
- **Photo Auto Pilot** — each scene = one image. Optional reference images for style/subject. Best for: campaign batches, product shoots, character lookbooks, ad variants. Pass `workflow_type: "image"` (or omit — image is default).
- **Video Auto Pilot** — each scene = one short video clip. Optional reference image per scene anchors the starting frame. Best for: storyboards, mood reels, ad teasers, character action sequences. Pass `workflow_type: "video"`.
- **Cinema Manual** — per-scene **first frame + last frame** + per-scene prompt. Full cinematic control over composition transitions. Best for: hero shots, controlled camera moves, deliberate edits.

### Identity & Style Locks
- **Visual DNA** — attach a character/product preset via `visual_dna_ids` to lock identity across all scenes (e.g. main character + product + side character). The cap is per model — read `max_visual_dna` from `list_models`. See `workflows/visual-dna.md` for the `@name` syntax — every DNA must be tagged inside the prompt.
- **Moodboard** — attach `moodboard_id` (or `moodboard_ids`) for a curated mood/style reference that anchors the aesthetic of the whole batch.
- When the user mentions a recurring character/product, **ask** if they want to use a Visual DNA and recommend it. Same for a consistent aesthetic → recommend a Moodboard.

## CRITICAL Kolbo Platform Rules

- **Aspect ratio and resolution are MCP-tool params** (`aspect_ratio`, `resolution`) — NEVER include "16:9", "9:16", "1024x1536", "2K", or any size syntax inside the scene prompts.
- **Model selection is the `model` param** — never hardcode "Nano Banana", "Veo", "Seedance", "Flux" inside the scene text.
- Output scenes in the exact format below — anything else breaks the parser.
- **Never pass `num_images` to `generate_creative_director`** — use `scene_count` (1–8). `num_images` is for `generate_image` (same prompt, different seeds).

## The Output Format (non-negotiable)

All scenes go in **ONE fenced code block** in this exact shape:
```
Scene 1: <prompt for scene 1>
Scene 2: <prompt for scene 2>
Scene 3: <prompt for scene 3>
...
```
- One scene per line. Each line starts with `Scene N:` followed by a single concise prompt.
- **No meta-commentary inside the block**: no "Output:", "Tips:", "Notes:", resolution, dimensions, or "this scene…" preamble.
- Number sequentially from 1. Hard cap at 8 scenes.

## How to Build the Batch

### Step 1 — Pick the right mode
- Single static asset per scene → **Photo Auto Pilot**
- Motion / camera moves → **Video Auto Pilot**
- Controlled first→last frame transitions → **Cinema Manual**

### Step 2 — Decide the narrative arc
A great batch isn't 8 random shots — it's a sequence with intent. Pick one structure:
- **Campaign**: establishing → product hero → lifestyle → detail → close
- **Storyboard**: setup → inciting action → escalation → climax → resolution
- **Character lookbook**: full body → 3/4 → portrait → action → environment
- **Ad concept**: hook → tension → reveal → CTA
- **Variant exploration**: same concept, varying angle/lighting/mood/palette

### Step 3 — Write each scene under the right framework

**Photo Auto Pilot scene prompt** (image instruction):
- Vary at least one axis between scenes: angle, lighting, mood, framing, palette.
- Concise: 1–3 sentences. Concept-led, not keyword soup.
- Subject + Action + Setting + Style cue.
- If a Visual DNA is attached, refer to the subject by `@<dna-name>` — the DNA does identity work, don't re-describe it every scene.

**Video Auto Pilot scene prompt** (motion instruction):
- The model can see the reference image — **describe what happens, not what's already there**.
- Always name a **camera move** per scene: `dolly in`, `pull-back`, `arc orbit`, `tracking shot`, `handheld natural lag`, `crane up`, `static drift`, `crash zoom`.
- Format: `<action> + <camera move>`. Short and action-led.
- Don't re-describe what the image already shows; describe the verb.

**Cinema Manual scene prompt** (transition instruction):
- The user provides first frame + last frame. Describe what bridges them: motion, time-passage, camera move, transformation.
- Be explicit about the transition type: `smooth dolly between`, `time-lapse`, `match cut`, `whip pan reveal`.

### Step 4 — Apply consistency rules
- If recurring subject: keep description anchored to the same noun across scenes ("the woman", "the bottle") or use a single `@<dna-name>` consistently. Don't rename her in scene 4.
- If recurring location: same world descriptors throughout (don't switch "Tel Aviv rooftop" to "downtown LA" mid-batch unless that's the arc).
- Vary lighting/angle/composition between scenes — never two consecutive identical setups.

## Output Discipline

- Final scenes in ONE fenced code block in `Scene N:` format. **No model names, no resolutions, no aspect ratios inside scenes.**
- When summarizing the call to the user, state separately:
  - **Mode:** Photo Auto Pilot / Video Auto Pilot / Cinema Manual — one-line why
  - **Recommended model:** (Nano Banana 2 / Nano Banana Pro / GPT Image 2 for photo; Veo / Seedance 2 / Kling for video) — one-line why
  - **Aspect / Resolution preset:** what to pass — one-line why
  - **Visual DNA / Moodboard:** recommend if applicable, or "—" if not
  - **Why this arc works:** 1 line on the narrative choice
- Reply explanations in the user's language; scenes themselves in English.

## After Generation

**Share results as individual URLs, one per scene. Do NOT create an HTML grid artifact or any combined layout.** Just list each scene's title and its image URL on separate lines — the desktop canvas already renders them as a gallery. See SKILL.md "Generated URLs in chat".

## Character-Driven Video — Frames First

SKILL.md's frames-first rule applies. The Creative Director deltas: generate the frames via `generate_creative_director` with `workflow_type: "image"` (+ `scene_count`, `visual_dna_ids`), then animate each approved frame with `generate_video_from_image`, passing it as `image_url`.

## UGC sets and thumbnail sets

Two batch shapes come up constantly and both have their own craft file:

- **UGC set** — same creator or product, several angles, all pretending to be one camera
  roll. Put the phone-look line in EVERY scene worded identically (a look written once at
  the top drifts by scene 4), vary the angle and the moment rather than the look, and never
  mix a graded scene into the set. See `workflows/ugc-smartphone.md`.
- **Thumbnail set** — vary the CONCEPT (bold → minimal → saturated → dark moody →
  typography-forward), never the words; keep the text to 2–4 quoted words and forbid every
  other word on the image. See `workflows/thumbnails.md`. Kolbo also ships a dedicated
  **Thumbnail Generator** tool that runs on Creative Director and fans out 4–8 art-directed
  variations of one topic — name it when the user just wants options.
